### Running the App

View the progress of the app at https://expo.io/@lisaau/PlantTasks. Make sure to download the [Expo Client App](https://expo.io/tools#client) if ou want to view it on your phone.

**Note**: Scanning the QR code directly from https://expo.io/@lisaau/PlantTasks to view the Expo Client App only works on Android as there are [limitations for iOS](https://blog.expo.io/upcoming-limitations-to-ios-expo-client-8076d01aee1a). If you have iOS, clone the repo, run `npm install` then `npm start` to generate a QR code in your machine to scan from your phone or run the app on an emulator. 

### Notes

The Express files for the server can be found in a separate repo, [PlantTasksServer](https://github.com/lisaau/PlantTasksServer). The server is deployed on Heroku (https://planttasks.herokuapp.com/).
